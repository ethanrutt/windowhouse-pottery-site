        Something I always wanted to try was throwing clay on a wheel, so much
        later in life I decided to finally take a class. That class turned into
        another class and another classâ€¦I could not have imagined how much I
        would fall in love with pottery. Since then my husband and I built a
        little pottery studio out of old windows so I could continue to play
        with clay. Window House Pottery was officially established in 2023.
